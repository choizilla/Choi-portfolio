                <!-- <h4>About</h4> -->
                <h4>Choi is a web designer with a branding background who can code fairly well</h4>
                    <p>Originally specialising in Graphic Design after graduating at <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins">Central Saint Martins</a> in 2011, I pivoted togethers digital design after witnessing the power and potential of the web for applications and online services. Having worked at startups, agencies and as an integrated in-house designer and developer, I have a rich working experience in both creative and tech environments.
                      <h4>12 years of experience</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>4 years in e-Commerce</strong></li>

                <h4>How I work</h4>
                    <!-- <p>Listen, watch, then do.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>A common theme I saw amongst both agencies and in-house development teams was friction between departments during collaboration.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>Communication between diffferent skill areas was often ineffcient because there was friction caused by technical and specialist jargon, knowledge gap, as well as resistance to cross-skill. -->
                    <p>From the experience of working in both tech and creative teams, in order to truly optimise efficiency between the different roles in a product building team, I found that designers such as myself should not heavily rely on UI design softwares such as Invision, Adobe XP, or Sketch. Learning the fundamentals of programming and basic ideas of how code and systems work allows designers to understand technical restrictions, which allows us to find areas to creatively exploit.</p>
                    <p>By harnassing both my creative and technical sides, I can now take an idea from whiteboard straight to build&mdash;with a little help from team mates and minimal use of graphic software (Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator) inbetween. I've developed a set of unusual skills to fast-track communication and project development, creating beautiful visuals with amazing user experience in mind.</p>
                    <p>I’m a great addition to teams with designers who can’t code and developers who struggle with visual design. I can help simplify technical jargon for the wider team too.</p>  
                    <p>So far, I’ve helped music, pharmaceutical, print, and accounting brands with their digital services and products. Come and see the <a href="/projects.html">full list of clients and projects</a> I’ve worked on or drop me an email if you’re interested to find out more.</p>
                <h4>Special notes</h4>
                <p>My love for music lead to the co-founding of <a href="https://jrocknews.com/">JROCK NEWS</a>, music publication which was featured on Japanese national television channel, NHK.</p></p>        
                <p>As for hobbies, if I'm not online <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, I'm probably baking. It's essentially chemistry, but the laboratory (kitchen) and chemicals (ingrdients) are far more accessible.</p>
