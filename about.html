                <h2>About Choi</h2>
                <h4>what I do?</h4>
                <p>TL;DR I’m a designer who can code.</p>
                <p>Are you looking for someone to work magic into your brand’s eCommerce and digital product expereince? I can advise and design beautiful mobile responsive eCommerce stores and websites, assist with builds, as well as improving existing
                    sites and stores to optimise conversion and efficency.</p>
                <h4>bridging the gap between developers & designers</h4>
                <p>I’m a great addition to teams with designers who can’t code and developers who struggle with visual design. I can help simplify technical jargon for the wider team too.</p>
                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>Originally specialising in Graphic Design after graduating at at <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins">Central Saint Martins</a> in 2011, I pivoted togethers digital design after witnessing the power and potential of
                    the web for applications and online services ten years ago.</p>
                    <p>With over a decade of expereince at startups, agencies and as an integrated in-house designer and developer, I also co-founded a <a href="https://jrocknews.com/">music publication</a> which was featured on Japanese national television channel, NHK.</p>
                    <h4>How I work</h4>
                    <p>Listen, watch, then do.</p>
                    <p>A common theme I saw amongst both agencies and in-house development teams was friction between departments during collaboration.</p>
                    <p>Communication between diffferent skill areas was often ineffcient because there was friction caused by technical and specialist jargon, knowledge gap, as well as resistance to cross-skill.In order to truly optimise efficiency between
                        the different roles in a product building team, I found that designers such as myself should not rely on UI design softwares and learn the fundamentals of programming and basic ideas of how systems work.</p>
                    <p>By harnassing both my creative and technical sides, I developed a set of skills to fast track communication and builds with speed, beautiful visuals and amazing user experience in mind.</p>
                    <p>So far, I’ve helped music, pharmaceutical, print, and accounting brands with their digital services and products.
                        <p>Come and see the <a href="/projects.html">full list of clients and projects</a> a I’ve worked on or drop me an email if you’re interested to find out more.</p>
