                <h1>Decoding Tech Talk <br>Workshop</h1>
                <h2>Profiting From Technology Through Confident Conversations</h2>
                <p>This workshop is for non-technical executives—CEOs, CMOs, Heads of Sales, and more—who need technological solutions and innovations to achieve their goals, but find it incredibly frustrating to negotiate with the technical experts who
                    hold the keys to engineering success.</p>

                <p>The tech wizards mumble mystical spells to their inscrutable machines and as if by magic, your wifi connects, your website takes payments, and your suppliers get paid. Engineers couch their sorcery in strange language: "tech debt" and
                    "middleware", "story points" and "cloud computing"; the unfamiliar words and ideas are intimidating and off-putting. And unlike every other part of your business, techies somehow escape accountability for their budget—sometimes it
                    feels like you're just throwing money at your IT cost centre and hoping you get a return on your investment, or at least working laptops. But there's a better way.</p>

                <p>If you knew how to approach the wizards without fear; if you built trusting relationships with IT (yes, I said "trust IT"!); if you made effective two-way commitments and engineers were clearly accountable for their business results; then
                    the tech money pit could become a fountain of innovation and profit. If the jargon were familiar, not intimidating; if IT initiatives came with risk analyses and business cases; if your engineering culture matched your business culture;
                    then you'd unlock massive value from some of your most expensive and specialised employees. <em>I can show you how.</em></p>

                <p>After just four hours with me and a small group of your peers, you will:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use the Baloney Test</strong> to sort the profitable wheat from the technobabble</li>
                        <li><strong>Lift the lid on tech</strong> with meaningful metrics that highlight waste and cost saving opportunities</li>
                        <li><strong>Reprogram your tech leaders</strong> so they're driven to boost revenue and customer satisfaction, not "fix tech debt" and "implement microservices"</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask penetrating, confident questions</strong> that tell you quickly whether your tech team is off target</li>
                        <li><strong>Unleash <em>daily</em> delivery</strong> of visible, profitable returns on your IT investment</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Unique elements of this workshop include:</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roleplaying and improving&mdash;live!&mdash;your most frustrating conversations with engineers, then practising what you've learnt with real techies who join as my guests</li>
                        <li>Developing a personal list of tech info sources that will keep you up to date with the latest tech trends in your industry</li>
                        <li>Building a dictionary of the tech terms you find most confusing and what they really mean (sometimes nothing!)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>There's no need for travel or masks&mdash;we'll do the whole workshop remotely over Zoom. No more than ten participants will join, to ensure everyone has plenty of "air time". The first five folks who sign up will get 30 days of unlimited
                    access to me via the Squirrel-Phone (like the Bat-Phone but better!), so you can ensure you are successful in applying what you've learnt to your business and your needs. The investment for this intensive half-day remote workshop is
                    £1000 (includes VAT)—with a 20% discount for those signing up before 1 March.</p>
