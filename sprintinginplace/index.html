    <p>
        This is the home page of the book <em>Sprinting In Place</em> by <a href="http://blog.jeffreyfredrick.com/">Jeffrey Fredrick</a> and
        <a href="http://douglassquirrel.com">Douglas Squirrel</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We argue that the main reason agile teams aren't agile is that they forget to share valid information, have difficult conversations, and build relationships. We show how the values of the
        <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> support these efforts and explain techniques from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Argyris">Action Science</a> to help readers adopt these approaches.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have written a
        <a href="sprintinginplace-samplechapter.pdf">sample chapter</a> and would welcome your <a href="mailto:ds@douglassquirrel.com">comments</a>.
