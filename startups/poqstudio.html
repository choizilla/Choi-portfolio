<h1>Poq Studio - 12 June 2014</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Startup name</strong>: Poq Studio, <a href="http://poqstudio.com">http://poqstudio.com</a></li>
  <li><strong>Founders</strong>: Jun and two others</li>
  <li><strong>One-sentence summary</strong>: The app commerce platform that powers retail fashion brands</li>
  <li><strong>Startup Stage</strong>: 2 years old, solid agency business in place, raising Series A</li>
  <li><strong>Current Funding</strong>: Two VCs and Seedcamp</li>
  <li><strong>Question</strong>: How can Poq scale a small, successful agency model to a much larger business?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Poq's current model works well - they build apps for mid-size brands. They correctly perceive that this is hard to scale, so Jun and I came up with three ways we might make it scalable. (One thing we didn't consider was trying to sell a platform version of their product to larger brands - I just couldn't see how any but the very largest brands could ever need this as their app needs are relatively modest.)
</p>

<p>
First, they could set up a franchising business and sell not only technical tools for creating apps, but also the marketing and customer-service processes to go with these, so a freelancer or small agency could buy a whole product to resell to their customers. I suggested that this might be particularly interesting if they can internationalise the product so they can market to potential franchisees in lots of different countries.
</p>

<p>Second, they could simply automate as much of their current agency model as possible - including training for new staff and detailed procedures for app builders to follow - and scale it in the way large consultancies do, like Accenture or PWC. They would need to accept that this will be a people-intensive business but it is perfectly possible to make it work.
</p>

<p>
Last, they could look at pivoting hard, using the current business as a cash cow while they discover what other types of problems their current customers have, perhaps in an adjacent area where their skills can be applied - for example, perhaps brands need apps for their staff to use at trade shows when talking to buyers, as a replacement for a pricing book.
