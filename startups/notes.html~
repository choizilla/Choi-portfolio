<h1>Squirrel's Startup Notes</h1>
<p>
I meet regularly with interesting startups, chiefly in London, and offer them
advice based on my experience in the startup world over the last fourteen
years. I always say the advice is worth what they pay for it (which is 
nothing - the coffee is on me!) but they seem to keep coming back, so it must
be useful for something. Recently I decided to keep notes on the startups I
see and to follow up with them on how the advice turns out for them, and
the results are below. Enjoy - and do 
<a href="mailto:ds@douglassquirrel.com">email me</a> to discuss any of the
ideas below or to arrange a visit sometime soon.
