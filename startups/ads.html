<h1>Anonymous Data Startup - 24 June 2014</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Startup name</strong>: Anonymous Data Startup (ADS)</li>
  <li><strong>Founders</strong>: A and M</li>
  <li><strong>One-sentence summary</strong>: One-stop solution for a problem plaguing companies with large volumes of data.</li>
  <li><strong>Startup Stage</strong>: Building MVP</li>
  <li><strong>Current Funding</strong>: Bootstrap</li>
  <li><strong>Question</strong>: Does it seem viable to release the product as open source and sell support for it? How can ADS acquire customers?</li>
</ul>

<p>
This startup preferred to remain anonymous, so I've obscured some details about them.
</p>
<p>
The open-source model seems to me to be high risk; ADS could spend a lot of effort on building something great, but find only at the end that users may not be willing or able to convert into customers. I recommended instead that they consider selling consultancy services, something they are already doing a bit of to keep alive. They can sell these services without making a big deal of the product, then deliver the result using the product and get a lot of feedback about it and (they hope) a referenceable customer using it. This won't scale of course but seems a viable means of pursuing customer development.
</p>
<p>
ADS have found one customer through friends but don't think direct referrals like this are likely to produce enough people who want to try the product, and I agree. Financial services seems a natural data-hungry industry to go after but, as I often tell everyone who will listen, it is a closed club and very difficult to break into if you don't already have a phone full of numbers - and unfortunately A and M do not have that sort of contact list. We talked about many industries but all seemed to require heavy-duty enterprise sales, unlikely to suit hackers like A and M and as they are bootstrapped, unlikely to come from a sales hire either. I would prefer to find a mid-range niche, populated with companies small enough to make buying decisions quickly but still large enough to need the product. I didn't have any bright ideas except that maybe delivery companies would suit - often family-run and relatively small at the head office, but with a lot of lorries and containers on the go and therefore probably data-hungry especially if they have real-time sensor data on delivery locations.
