</ul>

<p>
A slightly unusual setup - the founder is in Belgium building 
</p>

<p>
in Belgium,aiming at enterprise BPM, Peter wants to do CD to determine whether market in UK for self-service BPM like IFTTT. How to do CD? Start with profile: frustrated employees, medium-sized org (so accessible,can buy), lots of emails or phone calls arriving with work and manual process to follow. Also target industries where this is known problem. 2.go to network,use linkedin, people should tear out of his hands, willing to groan - if not interested, wrong industry or profile. Keep open mind about what he hears - product may not be suitable. E.g. incoming may be faxes or calls, no integration with those methods. Paper demo or real demo,but not the focus - listen. Find out budget, what would they pay? 5/mo not interesting. If possible aim for what they can approve themselves.Don't worry about how priced (per transaction,per month, something else) - total cash key, builds business case for belgium.
