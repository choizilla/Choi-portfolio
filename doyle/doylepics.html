      <H3>Trips and People</H3>

        <P> 
          <A HREF="http://www.drdemento.com/">Dr. Demento</A> is a Reed 
          graduate whose international 
          <A HREF="http://www.fix.net/~krellan/drd/">radio show</A>
          contains every novelty tune you've ever heard of.  He was easy to
          get for the photo shoot.

          Another Reed alum, 
          <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</A>, was 
          a little harder to get to, but was happy to pose for a quick photo
          in between phone calls at home.

          Among other shots on our trip with the bird to the Bay Area, we
          dragged it to 
          <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Jet Propulsion Labs</A> and 
          <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</A>.

      <H3>Trading Card Photos</H3>

        <P>
          The following photos (and others) were on the back of the trading 
          cards made by the Doyle Owl Patrol.  We used whatever junk we had
          lying around as props to pose the owl with.
