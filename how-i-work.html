                <p>I speak and train regularly on software development and management topics. For example, recently I gave two conference talks based on experiences at Geckoboard - watch them below if you are interested.</p>

                <p>In my training sessions, I frequently suggest that teams adopt an <a href="https://scrumandkanban.co.uk/slicing-stories-vertically/">elephant carpaccio</a> approach to building software, with <em>daily</em> releases of <em>valuable</em>                    features. A common objection is that one or another feature cannot be split into small, valuable, customer-visible features that can each be completed in a day - so I make a bet with participants that if I can't help them do so for
                    their hardest feature, I'll buy them a beer. So far I haven't had to buy any beers, but if you're interested in being the first, <a href="mailto:ds@douglassquirrel.com">send me a challenge</a>!

                <h2>Podcast and Book</h2>
                <p><a href="http://blog.jeffreyfredrick.com/">Jeffrey Fredrick</a> and I wrote a book called <em>Agile Conversations</em>, in which we argue that the main reason agile teams aren't agile is that they forget to share valid information, have
                    difficult conversations, and build relationships. We suggest ways readers can diagnose and address problems in their own agile teams.
                </p>
                <p>To develop the ideas in the book further, we are also creating weekly podcast episodes about various ways agile teams go wrong and how to address their difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>For more about both projects, see the

                <h2>Action Science</h2>
                <p>Action Science is a theory of organisation and management that I find very helpful. It is especially appealing for those (like us engineers!) who prefer sharply defined, step-by-step methods instead of wooly exhortations and vague models.
                    I use techniques like the ladder of inference and two-column case studies both in my own transformational work and when training founders, CTOs, and other senior leaders.</p>
